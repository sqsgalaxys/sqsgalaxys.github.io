1. This chapter will be about getting started with Git.
2. We will begin by explaining some background on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to get it set up to start working with.
3. At the end of this chapter you should understand why Git is around, why you should use it and you should be all set up to do so.
4. Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
